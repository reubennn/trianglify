# Trianglify Background Image Generator

This repo uses the [Trianglify](https://github.com/qrohlf/trianglify) package to generate aesthetic background images. It contains simple helper functions to quickly generate the images to use in any project you like in either SVG or PNG format.

## Get Started

1. Clone the repo and run `npm install` to install all the require dependencies.

2. Set your options in the desired file under `/scripts`.

3. To generate the specified bulk number of SVGs: `npm run create:svg`. For PNGs, `npm run create:png`

4. Check out your generated backgrounds under `/images`.

## Future Endeavours

One day I may generate a complete UI to generate the images using React... But for now we have to live with this dry code-based generator!
