# 📦 Trianglify Background Image Generator

This repo uses the [Trianglify](https://github.com/qrohlf/trianglify) package to generate aesthetic background images. It contains simple helper functions to quickly generate the images to use in any project you like in either SVG or PNG format.

## 🏃 Get Started

1. Clone the repo and run `npm install` to install all the require dependencies.

2. Set your options in the desired file under `/scripts`.

3. To generate the specified bulk number of SVGs: `npm run create:svg`. For PNGs, `npm run create:png`

4. Check out your generated backgrounds under `/images`.

## 🎨 Customization

Please check out the GitHub repo [Trianglify](https://github.com/qrohlf/trianglify) for help on customization!

## ⚖️ Licensing

The source code of Trianglify is licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License (GPLv3). This means that any websites, apps, or other projects that include the Trianglify javascript library need to be released under a compatible open-source license. If you are interested in using Trianglify in a closed-source project, please email qr@qrohlf.com to purchase a commercial license.

__However__, it's worth noting that you own the copyright to the output image files which you create using Trianglify, just like you own the copyright to an image created using something like GIMP. If you just want to use an image file that was generated using Trianglify in your project, and do not plan to distribute the Trianglify source code or compiled versions of it, you do not need to worry about the license restrictions described above.

## 🚀 Future Endeavours

One day I may generate a complete UI to generate the images using React... But for now we have to live with this dry code-based generator!
